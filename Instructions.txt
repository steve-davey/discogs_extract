DON'T FORGET TO PUT RELEASE ID IN COLUMN 1!

D:\>CD DAPI

discogs_extract.pl -h

discogs_extract.pl - grab data via API, etc

discogs_extract.pl [-h] [-k API_key] [-s file] release_list_file

  -h = help
  -k = API key
  -s = styles flat file
  -m = max number of rows to process from input file (for testing)
       default = 5,000

So, for example, to run the same test I did, unzip the attachment in your working directory, and run this command:

perl discogs_extract.pl  -m 10  davey_test.csv > test_output.csv
